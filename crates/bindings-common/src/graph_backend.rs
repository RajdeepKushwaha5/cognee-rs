//! Process-wide registry of graph-backend factories, keyed by name.
//!
//! [`cognee::cognify::CognifyConfig::with_graph_backend`] (added in #239) lets a
//! **Rust** caller swap the LLM fact extractor for a
//! [`ChunkGraphExtractor`]. Every other caller — the C API, the Python wheel,
//! the Neon addon, the JNI cdylib — reaches cognify through
//! [`crate::ops::pipeline`] with a JSON `opts` object, and had no way to say
//! which extractor to use: the seam was reachable from Rust only.
//!
//! This module closes that gap without teaching the bindings facade about any
//! particular backend. A backend crate registers a
//! [`GraphExtractorFactory`](cognee::GraphExtractorFactory) on the
//! handle's [`ComponentRegistry`](cognee::ComponentRegistry) (which
//! also registers the backend's config sections); the process-wide
//! [`register_graph_backend`] slot predates that and is kept as a shim, consulted
//! after the registry. [`crate::ops::pipeline::cognify_config_with_opts`] then
//! honours `{"graphBackend": …}` in the opts by looking that kind up, falling
//! back to the configured default `graph_extraction.backend` (`GRAPH_EXTRACTOR`,
//! default `llm`, the built-in extractor). No backend is registered in this
//! repository, so every current caller is unaffected: the only reachable new
//! behaviour is an error for a kind nobody can serve.
//!
//! ## Shape
//!
//! This mirrors the `set_handle_factory` seam the JNI crate already exposes
//! (`cognee-java-jni::handle`): a process-wide slot installed once, before the
//! first call that reads it, by whoever links the implementation in. The
//! differences are that there are many named slots rather than one, and that a
//! factory is `async` because building a backend can do real I/O (resolve a
//! model directory, open a runtime).
//!
//! ## An unknown kind is an error, never a fallback
//!
//! A caller who asked for a specific extractor and silently got the LLM one
//! would be billed for tokens they deliberately opted out of, and would get a
//! graph built by something other than what they asked for, with nothing in the
//! result saying so. [`graph_backend_from_opts`] therefore fails, naming the
//! kind and listing what this build does register.
